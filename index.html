<h1> The Benefits of <a href="tjtweeten.github.io/SL.jpg"> Slacklining</a> </h1>
<p> Slacklining has many benefits that most people don't think of when they think of <em>slacklining</em>. <br /> It improves your balance,
core strength, gives you better posture, and can help increase your focus.<br /> Slacklining is a full body workout that works your muscles as well as your mind!<br />
Slackining is a sport that has been around since the 19th century and has advanced from a rope to a strip of webbing.<p>
<h2><u>Slacklining for <i>Beginners</i></u></h2>
<p> When first starting out things can be a <b>little shakey</b>. The line will <strong>wobble</strong> but that happens to a lot of people,<br /> 
and it's just because you haven't built the muscles necessary to keep the line from <ruby>shaking</ruby>. <abbr>S.L.</abbr> will help build those muscles after just a few hours of practice,<br />
until eventually it won't wobble at all. A lot of people say to keep your <s>arms out straight</s> while on the line, but this is incorrect.</p>
<h2><u>Your Part</u></h2>
<p>It's <b>important</b> to remember that you have responsibilites when it comes to slacklining.</p>
