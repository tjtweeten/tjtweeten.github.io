<h1><u> The Benefits of Slacklining</u> </h1>
<p> Slacklining has many benefits that most people don't think of when they think of <em>slacklining</em>. It improves your balance,
core strength, gives you better posture, and can help increase your focus.<br /> Slacklining is a full body workout that works your muscles as well as your mind!<br />
Though the primary muscle groups being utilized are the core muscles, you also use your back muscles and strengthen your spine, which is what gives you better posture.</p>
<p> Slacklining can help eliminate stress and tension, which is why it is also meditative. You don't have room in your mind to focus on anything other then balancing. 
  <br />This reason is also why slacklining can improve your focus, it is truly a full body workout that can improve your muscles and your brain. It's like learning to ride a bike
  <br /> but with better rewards!</p>
  <p>Slacklining is a great way to help you train for other sports, every sport requires at least a little bit of balance and what better way to improve your balance then by using a slackline.
