<h1>Your Part</h1>
<p>It's <b>important</b> to remember that you have responsibilites when it comes to slacklining. Since trees are <b>vital</b> for the sport is it <b><u>important</u></b> that we protect them. You can do this by using
<br /> a Treepro or a Treepro xl. The Treepro is just a strip of velcro that you can wrap arouond the trees and your line so that your slackline does not damage the trees, the xl version is just a bigger strip for the larger trees.
<br />It's not just about protecting the trees though, using the Treepros will also protect the longtivity of line because it will prevent the bark on the tree from cutting into your line.</p>
<p>Another form of protection for trees if you don't have a Treepro is a piece of cardboard or old towel that can wrap around the entire tree. The only cons to using methods like these are that your line will often slip off of them 
<br />and right back onto the tree. So you could make a towel tube, which you can buy online for about 5 dollars or just make it yourself. Which making it yourself is not very hard since it is just a towel wraped in a tube so it can slide onto your line.</p>
<p>It's important that we as slackliners use these types of protection on the trees because it not only protects the tree and your line but protects the reputation of slackliners. There are even a few
<br />petitions out there that are trying to band people from slacklining because of the damage they cause to trees.</p>
