<h1><u> The Benefits of <a href="tjtweeten.github.io/SL.jpg"> Slacklining</a></u>
</h1>
<p> Slacklining has many benefits that most people don't think of when they think of <em>slacklining</em>.
<br /> It improves your balance,
core strength, gives you better posture, and can help increase your focus.
<br /> Slacklining is a full body workout that works your muscles as well as your mind!
<br />Slackining is a sport that has been around since the 19th century and has advanced from a rope to a strip of webbing.

<p> When first starting out things can be a <b>little shakey</b>. The line will <strong>wobble</strong> but that happens to a lot of people,
<br />and it's just because you haven't built the muscles necessary to keep the line from <ruby>shaking</ruby>. <abbr>S.L.</abbr> will help build those muscles after just a few hours of practice,
<br />until eventually it won't wobble at all. A lot of people say to keep your <s>arms out straight</s> while on the line, but this is incorrect.</p>
<h2><u>Your Part</u>
</h2>
<p>It's <b>important</b> to remember that you have responsibilites when it comes to slacklining. Since trees are <b>vital</b> for the sport is it <b><u>important</u></b> that we protect them. You can do this by using
<br /> a Treepro or a Treepro xl.The Treepro is just a strip of velcro that you can wrap arouond the trees and your line so that your slackline does not damage the trees, the xl version is just a bigger strip for the larger trees. 
It's not just about protecting the trees though, using the Treepros will also protect the longtivity of line because it will prevent the bark on the tree from cutting into your line.</p>
